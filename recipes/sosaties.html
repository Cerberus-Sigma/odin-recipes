    <p>South African Lamb and apricot sosaties. This recipe inspiration came from the latest edition of @woolworths_au fresh food magazine which I picked up free in my local store - how cool! There are some wonderful recipes in there, I'm a bit hooked. So, going back to these kebabs, I've never made them before and I was totally intrigued to see how they tasted. I imagined an almost Moroccan tasting dish with the spices that were used in the lovely marinade. There was enough left over to create another dish, which I'll share with you later. I also used the wonderful and efficient baking trays to cook these, which were kindly sent to me by @lakelandaus . More details and a full demonstration are in my story right now. Hope you're all having a brilliant start to the week </p>

    <p>Sosatie (pl sosaties) is a traditional South African dish of meat (usually lamb or mutton) cooked on skewers. The term derives from sate ("skewered meat") and saus (spicy sauce). It is of Cape Malay origin, used in Afrikaans, the primary language of the Cape Malays, and the word has gained greater circulation in South Africa. Marinated, cubed meat (usually lamb) is skewered and braaied (barbecued) shish-kebab style. Sosatie recipes vary, but commonly the ingredients can include cubes of lamb, beef, chicken, dried apricots, red onions and mixed peppers.</p>
