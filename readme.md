This project is my first project on html for The Odin Project

In this project I will make use of all the HTML tags we have covered in The Odin Project to demonstrate my knowledge.

Starting off with the boilerplate, moving into the head then body of the website.

I will be experimenting with different headings, making text bold and italic, as well as linking some other pages and images and also creating some lists.

At the end we will hopefully end up with a succesfull page comitted to github and working 100% as intended.
